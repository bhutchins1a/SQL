#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data. 


#1. How many titles in the table are movies (not TV shows)?
SELECT 
  count(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT MAX(DATE(date_added)) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title, type
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
ORDER BY type, title;
# or, if you don't care to differentiate between Movie and TV Show
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT director 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS people
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND title = 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
# (there are two of them released in 1942)
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
AND release_year = (SELECT MIN(release_year) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" WHERE type = 'Movie');

# or Chalotte's solution
SELECT title, MIN(release_year) AS released_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
WHERE type = 'Movie'
GROUP BY title, release_year
ORDER BY released_year ASC
LIMIT 1;
