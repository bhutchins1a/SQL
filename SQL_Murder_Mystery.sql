/** There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts
 *  and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime. **/

/** Here's what we know:
 * A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, 
 * but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 
 * and that it took place in SQL City. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database. **/

Crime scene report 20180115
SELECT description FROM crime_scene_report WHERE type = 'murder' and date = 20180115 and city = 'SQL City';

/** Output: Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
 * The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave". **/

Query for the interview text:
SELECT transcript FROM interview WHERE person_id = 14887;
1) Morty Schapiro - id 14887: 
I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

SELECT transcript FROM interview WHERE person_id = 16371;
2) Annabel Miller - id 16371: 
I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

/** We get some interesting information from these two:
 *  Morty saw a MAN
 *  The MAN had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag
 *  The number on the bag started with "48Z"
 *  The MAN got into a car with plate that included 'H42W'
 *  Annabel witnessed the murder and recognized the killer from the gym
 *  She last saw him on January 9th, 2018 **/
 
Work with information from Morty Schapiro. Find the name of the person who has a gold membership that starts with "48Z" and a license
plate that includes 'H42W'.

Jeremy Bower was at the gym on that date.
